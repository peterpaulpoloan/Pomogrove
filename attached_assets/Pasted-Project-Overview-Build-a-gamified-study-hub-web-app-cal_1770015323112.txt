Project Overview:
Build a gamified study hub web app called StudyStudio with a Pomodoro-based tree growth system, notes, flashcards with AI quiz checking, music playback, user profile, and a clean landing/home page. The backend uses Supabase for authentication and database storage. Ensure separation of concerns between frontend, backend, and database.

1. General Layout & Navigation:

Top navigation bar with buttons:

Home

Pomodoro Tree

Notes Vault

Flashcards

Music

Profile

2. Landing Page / Authentication:

Login / Sign up page with green gradient background

Use Supabase Authentication

Native email/password login

Google login

3. Home Page:

Section for:

Mission

Vision

Developers’ pictures and names (placeholder boxes for now)

Clean, well-separated sections

4. Pomodoro Tree Page:

Top-left: Pomodoro timer set to 25 mins study / 5 mins break

Options: Pause, End Session

Center: Animated tree

Tree stages: sapling → juvenile → adult

Grows after each completed Pomodoro session (25 + 5 mins)

Reflect growth as user level (max 100 levels) displayed top-right

Save current level and tree state to Supabase database

5. Notes Vault Page:

Clean, Google Notes-like layout

Users can create, edit, and save text-based notes

Notes stored in Supabase database

6. Flashcards Page:

Users can:

Create a quiz with a custom quiz name

Input their own questions as flashcards

AI checks the correctness of answers using a free AI API

Start Quiz button:

Shuffles flashcards

Checks answers in real-time

Shows score and percentage at the end

Options: End Quiz / Retry

Clean input interface

7. Music Page / Modal:

Modal to input YouTube or Spotify link

Floating mini-player with controls: Next, Pause, Stop

8. Profile Page:

Display:

User name

Highest Pomodoro level achieved

Streak display similar to GitHub contribution graph

Darker green = more frequent app usage in that month

Save and fetch all data from Supabase

9. Backend / Database:

Use Supabase services for:

Authentication

Notes storage

Pomodoro progress & tree level

Flashcards / quiz data

Profile info (name, streaks, highest level)

Ensure separation of concerns: frontend, API calls, database

10. Design & UX:

Clean, modern, responsive layout

Green accent for main elements (Pomodoro, buttons, headers)

Animated transitions where appropriate (tree growth, modals, quiz feedback)

Ensure data persistence across sessions

Additional Notes:

Create placeholder boxes for content that will be added later (e.g., developer pictures)

Ensure modular code structure for easier future updates
